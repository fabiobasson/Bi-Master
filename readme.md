### Resumo

<!-- trocar o texto abaixo pelo resumo do trabalho, em português -->

Context
The dataset was created by my team during the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2018, the goal was using the dataset to develop a model that can recognize the images with fire.
If you seek more info about the Context or the challenge, then you can visit Our team page.

Content
Data was collected to train a model to distinguish between the images that contain fire (fire images) and regular images (non-fire images), so the whole problem was binary classification.

Data is divided into 2 folders, fireimages folder contains 755 outdoor-fire images some of them contains heavy smoke, the other one is non-fireimages which contain 244 nature images (eg: forest, tree, grass, river, people, foggy forest, lake, animal, road, and waterfall).

Hint: Data is skewed, which means the 2 classes(folders) doesn't have an equal number of samples, so make sure that you have a validation set with an equally-sized number of images per class (eg: 40 images of both fire and non-fire classes).
